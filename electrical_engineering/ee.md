## How I structured this
Wanted to be able to keep everything within IDE. Usage of "tags" e.g. [math] or [measurement] is meant to be a way to ctrl+f search through this doc.

## Uncategorized
Electricity flows from the negative to the positive - electrons

## Measurement & Units
##### Volts [measurement][unit]
"pressure" in which the source (e.g. battery) pushes the current through the circuit.
##### Amps [measurement][unit]
1 Coulomb/second **Coulomb is 6.242x10^18 electrons or 6.2 quintellion electroncs; 6,231,509,074,460,760,000**

## Math & Equations

### Variables [math]

Energy (J) = joules (J)

Charge (C)

Voltage (V) = volts (V)

Current (I) = amps (A)

Resistance (R) = ohms (Ω)

Power (P) = watts

µ micro
Σ sum
√ square root

?? [math][equations]

$J / C = V$

1.5 Joules / 1 Coulomb = 1.5 Volts

#### Ohm's Law [math][equations][measurement][theory]

##### Voltage (V)
$I * R = V$

##### Current (I)
$V / R = I$

##### Resistance (R)
$V / I = R$

##### Derived expressions
$P / I = V $

$P / V = I$

$P / I^2 = R$


$√(P X R) = V$

$√(P / R) = I$

$V^2 / P = R$

Practical Example:

Measuring current and calculating energy being consumed with just voltage and current:

- $V = 1.5V$
- $I = 0.3A$

Resistance

$1.5V / 0.3A = 5Ω$

Power

$5Ω * 0.3^2A = 0.45W$

Energy Consumption

$0.45 * 1 hour = 0.45 Wh (Watt Hours)$
